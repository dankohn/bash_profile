## TOC Operating Principles

Now that CNCF has been active for over a year we want to start writing down what we have learned.  Future TOCs can still make changes, but there will at least be documented precedent.


We are Project-Centric
Principle: If it can be on a modern public source code control system, then it can be a project.  
                And we put projects front and center.

CNCF is a home for several kinds of “project” where community collaboration furthers the goals of the CNCF Members:
Open source software projects, e.g., Prometheus
Projects that develop interface and/or schema specifications (e.g., CNI), reference implementations, conformance tests, adaptors, etc., in order to facilitate interoperability.
Reference materials, such as architectures, stacks, guides, docs.

 
Projects are self-governing
Principle: Minimal Viable Governance


Our expectations around governance and support are all predicated on the notion that a CNCF project works like a typical modern “community-owned” open source software project, such as a person might discover hosted on Github.  That means that it has ‘committers’ and shared ownership using source code control, etc.  People who want the CNCF to support their ‘thing’ need to make it into a project and support “Github-style” communities.

Please do note that CNCF projects need not live on Github specifically.  

In the Github era, open projects are able to get a lot “done” without outside help.  The CNCF does not want to get in the way of that. This starts with “minimal viable governance”.  

The CNCF, TOC and GB are available for help if it is asked for.  
But: we do not want to impose bureaucracy on projects, because that will slow them down.
Minimal viable governance also means that the TOC does not step in at a tactical level to overrule project leads’ decisions.  
There are some basics like CoC - see below Draft Statement.  Including dealing with problematic leads & maintainers.
There is a formal & regulated system of Graduation Criteria for CNCF Projects
The TOC/CNCF want the ability to intervene if things go really wrong - ie. project leads are stuck and cannot fix things.  
Provide a template for new projects, a set of best practices to help jump-start the task of setting up a new project.

Draft Public Statement for website

The CNCF is committed to helping its member projects succeed, but without dictating or micromanaging how the projects are run. To that end, it requires only minimal viable governance criteria: a Code of Conduct with neutral processes for resolving conflicts, a documented governance model that includes a contribution-based process by which contributors can become committers or maintainers, and a clear definition of the top-level project leadership, with which the foundation will engage and inform and from which it may receive requests for funding and support. Once a project has graduated from incubation, new governance requirements cannot be imposed without consent of the project, except where legally required.

Notes
From https://www.cncf.io/projects/ Your existing committers still control your project, and we just ask that you have a neutral, unbiased process for resolving conflicts and deciding on new committers and moving existing ones to emeritus status.
From Charter Section 9. CNCF Projects 
(c) Existing open source projects should continue to run through their existing technical governance structure to maintain cohesion and velocity. Projects approved by the TOC for inclusion in the CNCF will be ‘lightly’ subject to the Technical Oversight Committee.
(d) A standard protocol to achieve committer status shall be established across projects based on an individual’s level and duration of contribution. Maintainer status is achieved through contribution to a given project over time and validation by peer committers.



We are looking for high-quality, high-velocity projects that fit ‘cloud native’

Principle: Great projects already have many ingredients to succeed.  First: do no harm.

Identify projects that have a real shot at being a useful tool in the evolving box of "cloud native" tech.  This is a mix of mature and early-stage projects.   Early stage may not have all the criteria we want: diverse contributor bases, formalized governance, interoperability, cloud-native designs, quality bar, etc. 

Some considerations:
Transparent, consistent technical and governance quality bar for graduation from incubation and also posted on CNCF website
Has users, preferably in production; is a high quality, high velocity project
Has a committed and excited team that appears to understand the challenges ahead and wishes to meet them
Has a fundamentally sound design without obvious critical compromises that will inhibit potential widespread adoption
Is useful for cloud native deployments & ideally, is architected in a cloud native style
Has an affinity for how CNCF wants to operate
Charter Section 9(e) New open source projects initiated in CNCF shall complete a project proposal template adopted by the TOC and be approved by the TOC for inclusion in CNCF. The TOC members shall be afforded sufficient time to discuss and review new project proposals. New project proposals shall include details of the roles in the project, the governance proposed for the project and identify alignment with CNCF’s role and values

No kingmakers & One size does not fit all
Preamble: 
Many problems in technology have more than one solution.  Markets are good at finding them.  There may be multiple good OSS projects for solving a problem, that are optimised for different edge cases.
Often multiple solutions get widespread use, for example because they are optimised for different constraints.  We don’t want to get in the way of that by insisting that one technology is “the answer” for each functional gap that we can identify today.  We believe that the market and user community provide a good mechanism for pushing the most appropriate projects forward over time.  We want projects to enjoy the support of the CNCF during that process.
There is no “one true stack”, cloud native applications cover many different use cases with different needs.  Many architectures are reasonable: from 12-factor to microservice, to stateful or data-intensive, to others.  And there are many scales from one node to many, from low to high latency, etc.  So “one size does not fit all”.
Principles:
No kingmakers.  The TOC picks projects with a real chance of achieving widespread use, and it does not pick a winner in each category.  Similar or competitive projects are not excluded for reasons of overlap. 
No one stack.  The TOC does not pick a “winning stack” ie. vertically integrated set of projects as a solution for multiple application problems.  Instead by encouraging interop, we hope that a range of patterns & “stacks” will emerge.  

Via the “no kingmakers” principle and “what is a project”, the CNCF may support several projects which show how a ‘stack’ is a solution to certain use cases.  For example some stacks might use a container orchestrator.  Other stacks might show how to integrate monitoring with other “observability” technologies, for cloud native apps regardless of their orchestration model.

This means that the CNCF is not promoting a single, monolithic stack of technologies. 

The CNCF is a badge of quality and velocity.  CNCF projects should be on a path to being tools that users can trust, broadly work together, and that meet other cloud native criteria.  But the CNCF badge does not mean “this is the standard tool”.
Overlapping projects are ok, especially where they make significantly different design tradeoffs
Who to pick:  The market is too young for us to pick winners - sometimes we shall identify several really promising tools that overlap in function.  Let's aim for eventual consistency based on real community use, and not create early deadlocks over "which one tool is best".  
CNCF resources, both time and money, to be extremely limited, so we do need to choose carefully, and therefore should do some reasonable due diligence, including considering alternative projects. 
Overall the TOC will try to maintain a public roadmap or “backlog” where it sees interesting projects emerging, or space for “RFPs”, and “WGs”.  While not a hard and fast document, this will help make dialogue with the community more transparent & efficient.




Not a standards body
Principle: CNCF promotes interoperability via interfaces that get real world use

Users and vendors both want as little friction as possible when it comes to integration.  Taking any two projects and putting them into a larger stack, product, platform, solution, etc., is always easier when this is the case.  For example cloud native storage vendors want as few moving parts as possible when it comes to making their products and services work with the various emerging container platforms.  At the same time the world is littered with the untouchable remains of failed ‘standards’ that promised to provide interoperability but did not get traction.

In the CNCF we like projects that are getting traction and may go on to become widespread and popular with end users and the ecosystem.  We apply this thinking to the area normally covered by ‘standards’ including specifications for APIs, SPIs, protocols etc.  Where a good interface exists we are happy to use it if our users like it, but we are not compelled to do so. 

We want markets and users to drive interop, not committees.  We want to help real world use happen faster, and foster collaboration.  We do not wish to become gated on committees.

We should focus on areas of rough 'de facto' agreement, under the proviso that early markets are also diverse.  Possible areas to target:
CNI - network
CSI - storage
CRI - runtime 
Openmetrics
CLI - logging
Spiffe
(there is demand for some kind of serverless-related event scheme)

How CNCF works with interface definitions like CNI, vs standards efforts like OCI

The world has a number of recognised international standards bodies such as IETF and W3C.  CNCF is not playing the role of a standards body.  By contrast, OCI is a standards body.

CNCF may develop written materials in the style of the current CNI interface document, or in the style of an IETF RFC for example.  These CNCF “specification” materials are not “standards”. It is in future possible that an independent and recognised international standards body takes a CNCF document as “upstream” and evolves it into a standard via (eg) the IETF process.  The CNCF is morally supportive of independent parties doing this, but does not see this work as its own responsibility.  For that matter, to date, no such exercise is in process.  

In general CNCF specifications will evolve as “living documents” side by side with the CNCF OSS projects that adopt them.   This means they are “dynamic and fast moving” whereas a typical IETF standard is ”static” and not subject to frequent updates & new releases.

For the avoidance of doubt: Any written “specification” materials in CNCF shall have the same status as CNCF open source software and project technical docs.  That is to say that specifications shall be updated and release versioned according to the conventions of a CNCF open source project.

IMPORTANT: Principle of Interoperability

CNCF values this highly: that for any given ‘specification’, multiple implementations exist.  Those implementations will use the project’s specification as the source of truth.

Moreover CNCF shall not claim interoperability if there is only one implementation.

Example: CNI

CNI fits all of the above requirements.  There is 1) a specification and it is codeveloped with 2) a library (libcni) and 3) ecosystem-contributed plugins.  Collectively (1-3) form “the CNI Project”.  In the future CNI might include a compliance test suite which can be run against those implementations.

CNI is a software project, but the centerpiece of that project is the set of interfaces documented in the specification.  Those interfaces live in the CNI Project.  By the principle of interoperability, the existence of multiple CNI implementations is encouraged. Those implementations will use the interface definition from CNI as the source of truth. 

Example: OCI

OCI is not in the CNCF.  The OCI project operates according to the norms of international standards bodies and has a clear primary goal: to provide a document that describes a standard set of interfaces for a container runtime, and label this as 1.0.  Nothing else is required.



Notes
Pro-real-world usage to drive interoperability -- it is desired where it makes sense but not required
But for mainstream customers to build cloud native apps and stacks using the
projects that we promote, it is a requirement that projects can be
glued together.
Not a standards body, but common interfaces are good and useful in that they facilitate growth of the ecosystem. 
we should avoid being a 'de jure' standards body that establishes canonical, perpetual, specifications and reference code.  For me a standards body is an algorithm for identifying areas of disagreement and then amplifying them indefinitely.  We should be the opposite.

We want a comprehensive toolchain

Principle: users don’t need to look beyond the CNCF for cloud native app tooling

Grand vision: CNCF should identify, facilitate and promote a *complete toolset* for cloud native applications and stacks at scales from small to large.  This enables customers to adopt good tools faster, and be less at risk of confusion and doubt.

We need to flesh out the portfolio of projects needed by users to succeed with cloud-native computing.  It's pretty clear where remaining gaps in the project portfolio are. We should try to fill some of those, and at least document the rest.   We can make more WGs to help with a few of those.   (Note that “detailed architecture and stack” can be a Project)

Above all we want to help projects

Principle: Our top priority is helping high quality high velocity cloud native open source projects be the main driver of customer adoption and success 

This section needs expanding.  
We want to be able to say that CNCF is a net positive for big & small projects; requires lots of coordination with project leads.  This is incredibly important and something that the TOC was unanimous on at Tahoe f2f.  Action to sync with LF/CNCF leads.

We have info about this on the website, but it could be easier to find and expressed better.  How CNCF can help projects: May 2016 deck about how CNCF can help projects has evolved into this statement on CNCF website & Vitess list of asks & Chris A comments.  

The TOC believes that “Helping projects” is the most important goal today.  These projects are doing a superb job of creating end user & developer narratives, so we need to help that happen more, and be cautious about mixing in too much foundation-level marketing too soon!  

Projects need: test automation and CI, cloud resources to test on, clear documentation, per-project marketing & evangelism, roadmaps for interop, advice from experts on governance and scalability.  And we need to make sure project contributors see what value they are getting & are not afraid to ask for help!

OVERALL top level goals

TOC-GB sync 
Commitment needed in form of budget and people to actually help projects - eg CI budget, and include other ideas from Tahoe
Seek Community & CNCF broader buy in

TOC to:
Publish a set of TOC operating principles and project criteria to future-proof CNCF (this doc is a draft for that)
Publish a plan for next 12 months - gaps, C*I, which special projects & WGs

TOC-Marketing sync: 
Fix Stabilize and converge on CNCF wide approach to marketing & mission / storyline; fix event strategy

If needed, vote charter updates / edits… eg
Schedule A: Initial CNCF Scope Vision or https://www.cncf.io/about/charter/
TOC mandate:  vi. defining common best practices as a template for new CNCF projects, if any, that are optional to follow.  iv. The TOC charter, model, approach, composition, etc may be modified by a two-thirds vote of the entire Governing Board.  iii. The TOC may meet virtually as needed to discuss emerging issues. Issues may be raised for TOC review by: c. a maintainer or top level project leader in a CNCF project established under Section 8(h),



Budget
Please could ED & GB make this happen:

CNCF needs to create web content that explains how the CNCF funds its goals.

Please address the following concerns via public and easy to understand materials:

Awareness of Goals & Projects
Users, community and contributors are unaware of the goals and how the sponsor money contributes to those goals.  They do not know what money is spent on “foundation level objectives” such as promoting cloud native, versus on “project level objectives” such as helping out their favourite project(s).  
List of budgeted activities & projects on CNCF websites
Explain how people can contribute in areas where there is budget
Explain how designated project leads can request or solicit budget
Explain how users can contribute in areas where there is NO budget
In general please open up CNCF finances - more transparency leads to community awareness & support.
Clarity about CNCF operating principles & how CNCF helps projects 
What can users expect CNCF to do?  What will the CNCF definitely NOT do, and why?  Every org has limits, eg. CNCF will not currently hire developers.  
Users & Developers must know that *anyone* can use, contribute to, and promote CNCF Projects - you do not need to be a member of the CNCF. 
Point out “project first” and “minimal viable governance”: principles that represent alignment between CNCF and expectations of modern OSS devs/users
Say what Membership is for (sponsorship etc).
Write up a simple piece of text here explaining operating principles, eg. Minimal viable governance.
Explain how budget gets stuff done to help OSS Projects & common infra (eg CI)
Explain who is employed by CNCF to do this work eg CI, tech/edu content, evangelism.  It needs to be easy to find this out.
Explain how CNCF serves as a neutral proxy, such as for ownership of Kubernetes assets, initiatives like conformance certification, and so on

Without this clarity, there may be some confusion leading to lack of trust, leading to people jumping to wrong conclusions about intent & purpose of organisation.  

CNCF needs to provide regular detailed project-by-project updates & budget news

In addition to the foundation level content, each project needs its own detailed and up to date area of the website.  Otherwise we have problems like: Frustration with lack of transparency - awkward for open source; Desire to contribute & get things done, but no clear path for doing so.

Transparent reporting on a quarterly basis, eg:
Regular project ‘health’ meetings between ED/COO/Staff & Project leads  
Public minutes for project status, community health, projects’ new requests 
Public success metrics of existing work
How contributors & project leads may ask for more budget 
How budget has been allocated from the CNCF to each project / activity

CNCF seems to need things that LF does not traditionally provide

Overall CNCF wants to push the envelope of the existing LF model.  It would be good for the GB and LF leadership to communicate with CNCF TOC to hear more about what TOC thinks the projects are saying & thinking.




Notes
Request for “working meetings” in which TOC+community drill into one topic
Open Agenda
Regular ED/COO updates on what value CNCF is getting from money that it spends on CI, Cluster, Tech Docs, Evangelism, and other resourced work.
Regular feedback sessions from current OSS projects, eg. could do a meeting dedicated to deep dives on “what do you need more help on?” from projects.

Other Notes

Purpose of working groups
Gather a group of people to look for candidate projects within a particular subdomain, with a goal of producing a proposal (or multiple proposals) at the end.
Some have suggested an RFP process: We could advertise that we're looking for a project that solves a particular problem, which has certain characteristics, and then review proposals submitted? 
Avoid things that lock us in.  
Avoid things that break trust.  

Education about “cloud native”
Why cloud native
Reference architectures
 We should publish reference architectures
and example apps where these enable greater clarity and help
communication.  Where possible we should be promiscuous about working
with other open source foundations and not try to create some kind of
"closed shop".

Helping Projects -- Events & Marketing

CNCF provides a variety of marketing assistance to its projects. This includes:
Public relations (PR)/analyst relations (AR) to announce new releases, new use cases, and put out longer lead stories.
Develop new logo, new website, or help with refinements of current site.
Assemble case studies of users.
In the case of kubernetes.io, manage the whole website outside of project documentation.
Producing blog posts and other materials describing aspects of our projects.
Provide a presence at CloudNativeCon/KubeCon in the spring in Europe and in the early winter in North America.
Funds cloud native meetups around the world, particularly through our Ambassadors. Any on-topic meetup can become a cloud native meetup and get free swag and reimbursement for food and beverages.
Organize custom developer-oriented conferences, such as PromCon. CNCF can handle the logistics or just part of the logistics (mainly the money and assistance lining up sponsors, in the case of PromCon), leaving the content to the maintainers.
Sponsoring booths at associated conferences in our space to raise awareness about our projects.
Running quarterly meetings with venture capital partners to showcase several of our projects each time.
Assembling a marketing demo showing the projects in use together.
Being available to assist in other marketing work, as requested.
